# WebReport
A prototype report system for dcm4chee 2. It uses CKEditor as it's core. 

I started this project for a freelance job that has gone awry. Feel free to use it anyway you like. 

Current features:
* querying studies on dcm4chee,
* selecting (and locking) a study for reporting  
* creating a report for the selected study,
* adding amendments to a report

## TODO
* Deliver reports (stop creation of new amendments)
* User login
** associate usuar to report
** user worklist (queue)
* Report printing
* Report templates
* audio
* Review error control
